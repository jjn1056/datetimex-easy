0.091   2022 September 23
    - Fixed issues with broken metadata in previous release and some
      fixes to POD issues and documentation fixes.
    - I removed all the complex pod weaver and dzil metadata plugins since
      they seemed to be failing to build a correct distribution.  I never use
      any of these plugins and can't get them to work.  Given this is a distribution
      that sees very little release cycle I don't find it useful to make this two
      file distribution so complicated.
